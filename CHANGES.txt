- Removed the ability to return plain text from queries when there were no XML
    nodes in the result. This was done to make the return type more consistent.
    Previously you could get either text or XML for a query result which was 
    inconsistent.
- Added the ability to run triggers based on actions in the database.
- Substantially refactored the administration interface to make it more general.
- Added the concept of datatypes to the system. Datatypes alow you to have more
    control over how certain types of content are handled in the system. The 
    system is still completely open, but this provides the ability to build out
    better tools.
- Moved all unit tests into a new directory to make it easier to run the full
    suite.
- Replaced PathUpdate with XMLFragment and converted everything to use that 
    instead of using raw libxml2 parser calls. 
    Using XMLFragment allows automatic freeing of document contexts which helps 
    prevent memory leaks. 
- Updated the XMLFragment update API to support namespaces.
- Expanded DbXslExtension to support full database operations from within XSL.
    Previously it could just do queries.
- Standard data types have been refactored to use the new datatype system.
- Fixed some encoding problems, hopefully system will properly support UTF-8 
    now. Might still be some minor problems.

- Added trackback support
- Added trackback autodiscovery on post pages
- Added remote-xpath-query and remote-content include tags that allow you to 
    include remote XML content into your posts.
- Greatly improved the HTML admin interface.
- Added comment and trackback spam URL blacklist support
- Refactored the stylesheet locations to separate system and user stylesheets.
    All stylesheets in dist/stylesheets are intended to be updated any time a 
    new version is released. User customizations can be made by overriding any 
    of the templates from the stylesheets in that directory. User styles are 
    stored in the top level syncato stylesheet directory.
- Reworked the URL scheme to add the ability to use post titles to provide 
    more descriptive URLs.
- Changed output from XSL process to generate XML instead of outputing HTML.
- Added a new URL parameter c to enable content queries. These are XPath queries
    run on rendered content. This allows you to extract fragments from the 
    HTML result.
- Added configuration options to turn url xpath queries and content queries off.
- Changed summarize function of WeblogXslExtension to no longer require sgmllib.
- Fixed summarize so that it expands embedded tags prior to doing the summary.
- Lots of cleanup to simplify the XSL files.
- Added additional indexes to the DB XML backend. This tuning provides a 
    substantial improvement in performance when running the latest version of
    DB XML.
- Renamed the root element on category definitions from category to 
    category-def. This was done to take better advantage of the indexing 
    facilities of DB XML. There's a script update.py that will update an 
    existing site.

0.6

- Added comment support.
- Moved weblog pings into a separate thread.
- Made pings generic so that any site that supports the weblogs.com interface
    can pe pinged.
- Added technorati pings to the default configuration.    
- Added a very rudimentary HTML administration interface. 
    (Just add and edit entries)   
- Added the PathUpdate API to enable document contruction and modification 
    using XPath to select nodes.
- Added category RSS feeds
- Added a file based database to make the software easier to get up and running.
- The file based database is the default out of the box.
- Began rearranging the XSL files to start separating user styles from 
    system styles.
- Initial Blogger and Metaweblog API implementations. (thanks Darryl VanDorp)
- Changed the command line scripts to use the web interface instead of accessing
    the database directly.
- Switched categories to key off of title instead of id.    
- Substantial improvements in the stability of the Berkeley DB XML backend.
- Changed the directory structure for servlets. There are now three types based
    on access restrictions. 
        open: open for all requests 
        restricted: restricts POST, PUT and DELETE
        closed: restricts all HTTP methods
